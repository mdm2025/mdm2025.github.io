										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										With new 360 video cameras and new generative AI technologies generating
NeRF video content, we are faced with new multi-view video content to be delivered to
high end mobile devices such as VR/AR headsets and smartphones. One of the main
goals with such a multi-view video content is to deliver high quality of experience to
users when streaming, viewing, and interacting with multi-view video content. Â In this
talk, we will discuss system and network challenges and solutions how to prepare,
stream, and deliver next generation multi-view video content to AR/VR end devices with
high quality of experience. Numerous potential system and network solutions are
becoming available to satisfy the streaming and viewing demands of multi-view video
content, including designing view-based protocols, experimenting with viewport
navigation and prediction techniques, and developing neural network-based streaming
and rendering services for interactive viewing. Current results of multi-view video
systems show promising new concepts and algorithms to enable high quality of
experience, but further challenges remain.<br>

										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										6G networks, currently only existing as concepts, are envisioned as portals to a fully digitized society. In this talk, we give an overview of main 6G trends, such as disaggregation, joint communication and sensing, as well as integration with aerial networks. We also assess them with respect to sustainability and the sustainable development goals. We further zoom in on the topic of integrated communication and sensing. Then, we show how an in-band full duplex communication radio can easily be extended with radar signal processing, almost for free. When extending the concept to MIMO, massive MIMO and cell-free networks, a range of opportunities arise for multi-static joint communication and sensing, even in scenarios with multipath and other non-idealities. We then consider aerial and non-terrestrial networks trends in 6G, and opportunities they give for sensing and communication.

Before that, she worked at imec and UC Berkeley. Her research centers around wireless networks that require networks that are ever more dense, heterogeneous, battery powered, and spectrum constrained. She has interests in cell-free communication, integrated communication and sensing, and aerial networks. She built a 5G testbed for distributed Massive MIMO at KU Leuven, is involved in a spectrum sensing open data initiative, and is now leading the way towards 6G tests in multiple large EU projects.
