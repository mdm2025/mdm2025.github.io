										<h3 style="color: #d52349">(June 3rd) Navigating Our AI-Enabled Future in High-Stakes Domains</h3>
										<span style="font-weight: bold">Speaker: </span>
										Dr. <a href="https://www.cs.wm.edu/~dcschmidt/index.html" target= "view_window">Douglas C. Schmidt</a>, 
										Dean of William & Mary’s School of Computing, Data Sciences & Physics<br>
										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										This talk presents an overview of our path toward an AI-enabled future for high-stakes domains like healthcare, national security, finance, etc. My narrative traces the arc from CMU/SEI’s 2021 National Software Agenda roadmap to ChatGPT’s 2022 “escape” from the lab, highlighting AI as an augmenter rather than an apocalypse. A four-quadrant map of AI use across the SDLC spotlights low-cost generative tools that slash cognitive load yet require critical thinking and prompt-engineering savvy. Success, however, hinges on trustworthy, assured AI, where non-determinism, data quality, and emergent behavior loom large. I emphasize shifting AI’s power upstream to analyze requirements, policies, and legacy test data, deriving smarter test cases and continuous assurance. To bridge the coming digital chasm, increased investment in research, policy, and upskilling must accelerate so AI-savvy professionals don’t leave the rest behind. Jump in now—because, like Maverick in Top Gun II, humans remain indispensable… at least today.

										<span style="font-weight: bold">Bio: </span>
										<a href="https://www.cs.wm.edu/~dcschmidt/index.html" target= "view_window">Douglas C. Schmidt</a> 
										is the inaugural Dean of William & Mary’s School of Computng, Data Sciences & Physics. With more than thirty years of experience as an internationally recognized computing expert, he is a sought-after educator and leader. As Dean, Dr. Schmidt is focused on advancing William & Mary’s efforts to prepare students for success in a data-driven world.<br>
										Prior to his role with William & Mary, Dr. Schmidt served as the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), a President-appointed Senateconfirmed position that advises the Secretary of Defense on operational and live fire test and evaluation of Department of Defense weapon and information systems.  Before his DOT&E appointment, Dr. Schmidt held a variety of roles at Vanderbilt University, including the Cornelius Vanderbilt Professor of Engineering in Computer Science, the Associate Provost for Research, CoDirector of the Data Science Institute, the Associate Chair of Computer Science, and a Senior Researcher at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems. He was instrumental in building Vanderbilt’s digital learning initiatives and continually developing innovative programs to serve students. Dr. Schmidt has also been affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute in various researchoriented positions for 20 years. <br>
										In addition to higher education, Dr. Schmidt has served in a number of roles in public and private sectors. From 2010 to 2014, he was a member of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (AF SAB), where he served as Vice Chair of a study on Cyber Situational Awareness for Air Force mission operations, as well as a study on sustaining hardware and software for US aircraft. He also served on the advisory board for the joint Navy/Army Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) initiative. From 2000 to 2003, Dr. Schmidt served as a Program Manager in the DARPA Information Exploitation Office (IXO) and Information Technology Office (ITO). He has also worked for a number of private companies, including Prism Technologies and Zircon Computing. <br>
										Dr. Schmidt's research over the past four decades covers a range of software-related topics, including paterns, optimization techniques, and quality assurance of frameworks and model-driven engineering tools that facilitate the development of mission-critical middleware for cyber-physical systems and intelligent mobile cloud computing applications. He is a highly cited author with over 50,000 citations to date and has published more than 700 papers and co-authored more than 10 books. He has also developed widely-used open-source DRE middleware, model-driven engineering tools and mobile cloud computing apps. His recent research focuses on prompt engineering techniques and paterns that enhance the accuracy and expressiveness of large language models and generative augmented intelligence platforms. Dr. Schmidt received Bachelor and Master of Arts degrees in Sociology from William & Mary and Master of Science and Doctorate degrees in Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine.

										<span style="font-weight: bold">Speaker: </span>
										Dr. <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/ram-d-sriram" target= "view_window">Ram D. Sriram</a>, 
										Chief of the Software & Systems Division, National Institute of Standards & Technology’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL)<br>
										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										In 2013, I had the privilege of co-organizing a panel with Vint Cerf at AAAS 2013, titled &quot;Smart
										Phones, Smart Devices, and Smart Healthcare.&quot; This panel explored the idea that next-
										generation networks, combined with the proliferation of smart phones, would leverage a vast
										array of resources with advanced sensing capabilities, transcending traditional physically linked
										computers to incorporate multimodal information from biological, cognitive, semantic, and
										social networks. We recognized that these emerging networks would have a profound impact
										on the future of healthcare. This vision led to the development of the P9 medicine concept,
										which I created in collaboration with Ramesh Jain and Eswaran Subrahmanian, and extends
										Leroy Hood’s P4 medicine idea. P9 medicine is a holistic approach to health care that
										encompasses nine key principles: personalized, predictive, preventive, participatory, pervasive,
										precise, privacy-preserving, protective, and reasonably priced. This framework serves as the
										foundation for a comprehensive digital health ecosystem. In this talk, I will delve into the P9
										concept and its intersections with other digital revolutions, including artificial intelligence,
										OMICs, and virtual and augmented reality. Additionally, I will outline a strategic plan for
										implementing digital wellness, which harnesses the power of information technology to
										promote robust physical and mental health. By leveraging these digital revolutions, we can
										create a transformative health care system that prioritizes prevention, precision, and patient
										empowerment.

										<span style="font-weight: bold">Speaker: </span>
										Prof. <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/klara" target= "view_window">Klara Nahrstedt</a>, 
										Swanlund Chair Professor, Siebel School of Computing and Data Science; Director, Coordinated Science Laboratory, Grainger College of Engineering, UIUC<br>							
										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										With new 360 video cameras and new generative AI technologies generating
										NeRF video content, we are faced with new multi-view video content to be delivered to
										high end mobile devices such as VR/AR headsets and smartphones. One of the main
										goals with such a multi-view video content is to deliver high quality of experience to
										users when streaming, viewing, and interacting with multi-view video content.  In this
										talk, we will discuss system and network challenges and solutions how to prepare,
										stream, and deliver next generation multi-view video content to AR/VR end devices with
										high quality of experience. Numerous potential system and network solutions are
										becoming available to satisfy the streaming and viewing demands of multi-view video
										content, including designing view-based protocols, experimenting with viewport
										navigation and prediction techniques, and developing neural network-based streaming
										and rendering services for interactive viewing. Current results of multi-view video
										systems show promising new concepts and algorithms to enable high quality of
										experience, but further challenges remain.<br>
