									High-Stakes Domains</h3>
								<span style="font-weight: bold">Speaker: </span>
								Dr. <a href="https://www.cs.wm.edu/~dcschmidt/index.html" target="view_window">Douglas
									C. Schmidt</a>,

								<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
								This talk presents an overview of our path toward an AI-enabled future for high-stakes
								domains like healthcare, national security, finance, etc. My narrative traces the arc
								from CMU/SEI’s 2021 National Software Agenda roadmap to ChatGPT’s 2022 “escape” from the
								lab, highlighting AI as an augmenter rather than an apocalypse. A four-quadrant map of
								AI use across the SDLC spotlights low-cost generative tools that slash cognitive load
								yet require critical thinking and prompt-engineering savvy. Success, however, hinges on
								trustworthy, assured AI, where non-determinism, data quality, and emergent behavior loom
								large. I emphasize shifting AI’s power upstream to analyze requirements, policies, and
								legacy test data, deriving smarter test cases and continuous assurance. To bridge the
								coming digital chasm, increased investment in research, policy, and upskilling must
								accelerate so AI-savvy professionals don’t leave the rest behind. Jump in now—because,
								like Maverick in Top Gun II, humans remain indispensable… at least today.

									Convergence of Technology, Data, and P9 Medicine</h3>
								<span style="font-weight: bold">Speaker: </span>
								Dr. <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/ram-d-sriram" target="view_window">Ram D.
									Sriram</a>,
								Chief of the Software & Systems Division, National Institute of Standards & Technology’s
								Information Technology Laboratory (ITL)<br>
								<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
								In 2013, I had the privilege of co-organizing a panel with Vint Cerf at AAAS 2013,
								titled &quot;Smart
								Phones, Smart Devices, and Smart Healthcare.&quot; This panel explored the idea that
								next-
								generation networks, combined with the proliferation of smart phones, would leverage a
								vast
								array of resources with advanced sensing capabilities, transcending traditional
								physically linked
								computers to incorporate multimodal information from biological, cognitive, semantic,
								and
								social networks. We recognized that these emerging networks would have a profound impact
								on the future of healthcare. This vision led to the development of the P9 medicine
								concept,
								which I created in collaboration with Ramesh Jain and Eswaran Subrahmanian, and extends
								Leroy Hood’s P4 medicine idea. P9 medicine is a holistic approach to health care that
								encompasses nine key principles: personalized, predictive, preventive, participatory,
								pervasive,
								precise, privacy-preserving, protective, and reasonably priced. This framework serves as
								the
								foundation for a comprehensive digital health ecosystem. In this talk, I will delve into
								the P9
								concept and its intersections with other digital revolutions, including artificial
								intelligence,
								OMICs, and virtual and augmented reality. Additionally, I will outline a strategic plan
								for
								implementing digital wellness, which harnesses the power of information technology to
								promote robust physical and mental health. By leveraging these digital revolutions, we
								can
								create a transformative health care system that prioritizes prevention, precision, and
								patient
								empowerment.

								Since their introduction in 2021, the concept of 3D multimedia displays using Flying
								Light Specks, FLSs, has started to gain wider adoption. An FLS is a small drone
								configured with light sources and sensors that enable it to detect human touch. A swarm
								of FLSs illuminates 3D shapes and animations in a fixed volume that are visible to the
								naked eye and responsive to direct interaction with bare hands. They are a building
								block of desktop 3D multimedia displays, a Dronevision, a room sized 3D multimedia
								display, a Holodeck, and our 3D world, Spatial Computing. They complement existing
								Augmented Reality (AR) and eXtended Reality (XR) glasses. They shape the frontiers of
								multimedia systems research with the potential to revolutionize how we collaborate and
								work, learn and educate, design and manufacture, receive and deliver healthcare, and
								play and entertain.

						The digital twin is recognized as digital copies of the physical world's objects stored in
						digital(cyber) space and utilized to simulate the sequences and consequences of target
						phenomena. Users can fully view the target through real-time feedback by incorporating the
						physical world's data into the digital twin. Given the importance of the digital twin, we have
						proposed Tsunami Digital Twin (TDT) as a new paradigm in tsunami science and engineering to
						enhance tsunami disaster resilience. The components of TDT are the transformation from
						&quot;Data&quot; to &quot;Information&quot; by integrating sensing, monitoring, and simulation;
						&quot;Interpretation&quot; of data and information; and &quot;Inference&quot; by using available
						data and information to draw conclusions and consequences and decide policies and responses for
						social resilience. Fusing these components is the key to gaining knowledge and insight for
						optimal solutions in the physical world. We report the progress of TDT applications underway in
						Japan and the US. The progress reports of TDT focus on the multi-platform computing capability
						for the operational GNSS-based real-time tsunami inundation forecast with offshore tsunami data
						assimilation, real-time tsunami exposure estimation using mobile phone data, and the
						optimization model of the rescue mission in the tsunami inundation zone.

						decade. However, in many disciplines of computing, such as artificial intelligence, cyber
						security and especially in quantum computing, not all groups are represented well. In order to
						encourage more representation from all groups in highly lucrative areas in computer science, it
						is essential that students and those in the workforce need mentoring from the time they start
						school around 5 years old until they finish their careers which is now at 70 or even 80 and
						beyond for many. Only then will more people have opportunities to be in positions of power in
						academic institutions (e.g., Engineering Deans) and in the C-Suite in corporations and corporate
						boards. For example, senior researchers and practitioners have to support junior colleagues in
						getting promotions and awards such as IEEE and ACM Fellows and various technical recognition
						awards. We need to explain the benefits of having a career in computing early. Also, as the
						workforce gets older and more people are leading long and healthy lives, we need mentoring for
						such groups so that they are motivated and develop technologies from the vast experience they
						have gained over decades of work experience.
						My keynote presentation on mentoring first discusses the benefits of a career in computing and
						stresses on the fact that a high paying job is necessary for every person so that he/she can be
						independent and not rely on others for survival. Second, it describes the importance of
						mentoring for career success that includes a discussion of some of my personal experiences, and
						provides advice to mentors and mentees. Third, it describes the benefits of playing the long
						game for career success. Finally, it provides some directions for the future.
