										<!-- <span style="font-weight: bold">Speaker: </span>Klara Nahrstedt, 									 -->
										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										With new 360 video cameras and new generative AI technologies generating
										NeRF video content, we are faced with new multi-view video content to be delivered to
										high end mobile devices such as VR/AR headsets and smartphones. One of the main
										goals with such a multi-view video content is to deliver high quality of experience to
										users when streaming, viewing, and interacting with multi-view video content.  In this
										talk, we will discuss system and network challenges and solutions how to prepare,
										stream, and deliver next generation multi-view video content to AR/VR end devices with
										high quality of experience. Numerous potential system and network solutions are
										becoming available to satisfy the streaming and viewing demands of multi-view video
										content, including designing view-based protocols, experimenting with viewport
										navigation and prediction techniques, and developing neural network-based streaming
										and rendering services for interactive viewing. Current results of multi-view video
										systems show promising new concepts and algorithms to enable high quality of
										experience, but further challenges remain.<br>

										<h3 style="color: #d52349">Revolutionizing Health Care: The Convergence of Technology, Data, and P9 Medicine</h3>
										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										In 2013, I had the privilege of co-organizing a panel with Vint Cerf at AAAS 2013, titled &quot;Smart
										Phones, Smart Devices, and Smart Healthcare.&quot; This panel explored the idea that next-
										generation networks, combined with the proliferation of smart phones, would leverage a vast
										array of resources with advanced sensing capabilities, transcending traditional physically linked
										computers to incorporate multimodal information from biological, cognitive, semantic, and
										social networks. We recognized that these emerging networks would have a profound impact
										on the future of healthcare. This vision led to the development of the P9 medicine concept,
										which I created in collaboration with Ramesh Jain and Eswaran Subrahmanian, and extends
										Leroy Hood’s P4 medicine idea. P9 medicine is a holistic approach to health care that
										encompasses nine key principles: personalized, predictive, preventive, participatory, pervasive,
										precise, privacy-preserving, protective, and reasonably priced. This framework serves as the
										foundation for a comprehensive digital health ecosystem. In this talk, I will delve into the P9
										concept and its intersections with other digital revolutions, including artificial intelligence,
										OMICs, and virtual and augmented reality. Additionally, I will outline a strategic plan for
										implementing digital wellness, which harnesses the power of information technology to
										promote robust physical and mental health. By leveraging these digital revolutions, we can
										create a transformative health care system that prioritizes prevention, precision, and patient
										empowerment.
