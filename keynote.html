										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										Heterogeneous human urban mobility data are being collected at unprecedented rates and are used extensively in several applications, from route planning and location-based services to urban planning and traffic management. We focus on the analysis of GPS trajectory data, with or without additional data sources. We present recent advances and highlight research challenges concerning the development of novel techniques for the problems of travel time estimation, multi-modal routing and multi-objective routing that utilize GPS trajectory data in real-time.										<br>

										<h3 style="color: #d52349">Sustainable 6G flexibility with integrated communication and sensing and non-terrestrial networks</h3>
										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										6G networks, currently only existing as concepts, are envisioned as portals to a fully digitized society. In this talk, we give an overview of main 6G trends, such as disaggregation, joint communication and sensing, as well as integration with aerial networks. We also assess them with respect to sustainability and the sustainable development goals. We further zoom in on the topic of integrated communication and sensing. Then, we show how an in-band full duplex communication radio can easily be extended with radar signal processing, almost for free. When extending the concept to MIMO, massive MIMO and cell-free networks, a range of opportunities arise for multi-static joint communication and sensing, even in scenarios with multipath and other non-idealities. We then consider aerial and non-terrestrial networks trends in 6G, and opportunities they give for sensing and communication.

										<a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00041938" target= "view_window">Sofie Pollin</a> is professor at KU Leuven focusing on wireless communication systems. Before that, she worked at imec and UC Berkeley. Her research centers around wireless networks that require networks that are ever more dense, heterogeneous, battery powered, and spectrum constrained. She has interests in cell-free communication, integrated communication and sensing, and aerial networks. She built a 5G testbed for distributed Massive MIMO at KU Leuven, is involved in a spectrum sensing open data initiative, and is now leading the way towards 6G tests in multiple large EU projects.
