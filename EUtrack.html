										<h3 style="color: #d52349">From Cooperative ITS to digital twins in a system of systems</h3>
										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										In the past years, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) have evolved into Cooperative ITS (C-ITS). Based on the detected traffic, controllers generated “green waves”. By means of V2V and V2I communication this was optimized to GLOSA (Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory) and advanced warning systems. Those concepts have been tested in large scale deployment projects like C-MobILE and are now state of the art. In NextPerception, Driver Monitoring Systems were extended to take into account the emotional state of the driver.
										<br>
										<br>
										In recent years Digital Twins have been the next step in making automation tasks more performant in domains where sensors, edge devices, cloud computing and AI are combined. We see that the usage of Digital Twins in Mobility is lagging behind and, when used, the Twin is only modelling one aspect on a single device.
										<br>
										<br>
										Simulation and data analysis are well handled in the Mobility and Traffic domain. Real-time reaction to changing situations is commonly used to guarantee safety and improved traffic flow. The basic building blocks for a digital twin are there but are insufficient to handle the situation where the actors are moving and changing from one situation to another and owned by different stakeholders.
										<br>
										<br>
										To model those complex situations, we need cooperating digital twins that dynamically work together in a trustworthy system of systems where a system can join our leave a group of heterogeneous twins.
										<br>
										<br>
										The DistriMuse project, which started in May 2024, intends to work on solutions to combine observations from various traffic participants into a common view of the situation. The focus in the project is particularly on the observation and protection of vulnerable road users in traffic situations. Furthermore, a match will be made between the focus of attention of the driver, and the developments in traffic, specifically focusing on the attention paid to VRU’s.

										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										Our planet is facing an uncertain future. Dealing with accelerating atmospheric warming, shifting geopolitical alliances, widening economic inequalities and worrying technological capabilities cannot be dealt with by individual countries. This is particularly the case for the seas and oceans that cover 71% of the surface, which absorb about 30% of carbon dioxide from human activities and carry about 80% of the volume of international trade. The talk will explain how EU finance and regulations on data bring 27 countries together to tackle these issues.

										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										Collecting Traffic data is expensive, yet it’s essential as a basis for any sensible transport policy. Because of the high cost local authorities limit the amount of traffic counting data collection to few, mostly main roads. Despite new technological possibilities, affordable traffic counts of traffic volumes at fine spatial granularity that are essential for traffic studies on infrastructure adjustments, smart traffic lights, new circulation plans, etc. are still lacking.
										<br>
										<br>
										Secondly, any change to local transport policy requires support from the public. Information, participation and awareness campaigns are needed to generate sufficient support for local transport policy changes. Citizen’s activism on transport issues is very high. Citizen involvement in the generation of traffic data can both reduce the cost of data collection as well as increase the support for any changes to the local transport policy.
										<br>
										<br>
										Telraam is a citizen-powered solution for collecting multi-modal traffic data with a purpose-built, affordable, and user-friendly device. In this presentation, we will show the technology Telraam uses and the method we use to establish a intricate collaboration between citizen and local transport policy makers to collect traffic counting data in an affordable manner.

										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										The EU is distinguished by its many small and medium-sized cities and towns. Almost half of all EU cities have populations between 50.000 and 100.000, inhabitants, and there are over 8.000 towns with populations ranging from 5.000 to 50.000. Together, these towns and cities are home to nearly 30% of the EU’s population. In Flanders, this figure rises to over 80%. This means that the majority of Flemish citizens is scattered amongst 285 cities and communities, resulting in significant challenges for mobility data management. Many of these challenges, such as resource scarcity and data deficiencies, can be addressed through collaboration among cities, sharing resources, data, and insights. This research introduces a novel approach for such a collaboration, using transfer learning algorithms. The method will be developed in the Citcom.ai project, which establishes Test and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) across Europe. Mechelen, a medium-sized city in Flanders, is one of these TEFs, and faces the same issue as many other cities: they lack data on mobility. The proposed method solves this issue, by using data from several other small and medium-sized cities to pretrain a predictive model, which is further refined using Mechelen's data. By combining data sources from different small and medium-sized cities, this approach leverages their collective strengths, resulting in more accurate predictions for all of them.

										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										To tackle key urban issues such as improving mobility, cities need to combine many different kinds of data coming from many different domains. “Work arounds” are needed to help, and this is the focus of the OASC/Living-in.eu Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms (MIMs). While global in scope, the MIMs are seen by the European Commission as a key part of supporting interoperability across Europe. The MIM methodology is on the point of being standardised by ITU.
